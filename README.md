The NotePix plugin automates the process of handling images inside your notes by uploading them directly to a GitHub repository. When you paste or drag an image into a note, it is instantly uploaded and the local link is replaced with either a fast CDN hosted URL for public repos or a secure internal link for private ones. This keeps your vault lightweight while ensuring your images remain accessible anywhere. It supports both desktop and mobile, provides AES-GCM encryption for your GitHub Personal Access Token and allows you to configure repository details, branches and folder paths. In private mode, images are displayed seamlessly in Reading View through secure token based fetching.
